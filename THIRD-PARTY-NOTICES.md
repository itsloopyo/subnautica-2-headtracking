# Third-Party Notices

Subnautica2HeadTracking bundles, statically links, or credits the third-party components
listed below. Each remains the property of its authors and is used under its own
licence. Where a licence requires the copyright notice, the conditions and the
disclaimer to accompany a binary distribution, the full text is reproduced here
verbatim, and this file ships at the root of every release ZIP we publish.

This repository redistributes no part of Subnautica 2: no game code, no
extracted assets and no data files. The one piece of game-owned material it
holds is the README gameplay clip, described under "Subnautica 2 footage"
below, which ships in neither release ZIP.

| Component | Version | Licence | How it ships |
|-----------|---------|---------|--------------|
| MinHook | v1.3.3 (`9fbd087`) | BSD-2-Clause | Compiled into `dxgi.dll` |
| cameraunlock-core | 67a82e334bcf32979d17965eab4b0f37a48a6ad0 | MIT | Compiled into `dxgi.dll` |
| OpenTrack | n/a | ISC | Not bundled; UDP protocol interoperability only |

## MinHook

Fetched from upstream at configure time and compiled into `dxgi.dll`.

- Upstream: https://github.com/TsudaKageyu/minhook
- Version: `v1.3.3`, pinned in `CMakeLists.txt` as commit
  `9fbd087432700d73fc571118d6a9697a36443d88`
- Compiled from upstream sources unmodified

MinHook carries two copyright holders: Tsuda Kageyu for MinHook itself, and
Vyacheslav Patkov for the Hacker Disassembler Engine that `src/hde/` is built
from. Both notices appear below exactly as upstream ships them.

## cameraunlock-core

Git submodule at `cameraunlock-core/`, compiled into `dxgi.dll`. Our own code,
MIT licensed, reproduced here so the notices are complete.

## OpenTrack

Not bundled and not linked. This mod implements the OpenTrack UDP pose datagram
layout so that OpenTrack (https://github.com/opentrack/opentrack, ISC licence)
and compatible trackers can drive it. No OpenTrack code, headers or binaries
are copied, linked or redistributed, so its licence triggers no notice
obligation here. It is credited because the wire format is its work.

## Subnautica 2 footage and screenshots

- **File:** `assets/readme-clip.gif` - ten seconds of ordinary gameplay, 800x450.
- **Rights holder:** Unknown Worlds Entertainment, Inc. and its parent KRAFTON,
  Inc., together with the rights holders of any third-party marks visible in
  frame.
- **Usage:** recorded from the game running with this mod, captured on a
  legitimately purchased copy, shown so a reader can see what the mod does
  before installing it.
- **Bundled:** no. It is kept in this repository only. The packaging scripts
  copy `README.md`, `LICENSE`, `CHANGELOG.md` and this file, never `assets/`,
  so the clip is in neither release ZIP nor anything the launcher deploys. The
  README embeds it by absolute URL so it still resolves for someone reading the
  copy inside a ZIP.
- **Licence:** none is granted or implied by this repository. This material is
  not covered by the MIT licence in `LICENSE`, and nothing here permits reuse
  of it. Rights holders who would rather it were not published: open an issue
  or reach us on Discord and it comes down.

## Subnautica 2

Subnautica 2 and all related names, logos, characters and marks are trademarks
of their respective owners. They are used here only to identify the game this
mod applies to, which is nominative use and not a claim of any right in them.
This project is an unofficial, fan-made modification. It is not affiliated
with, endorsed by, or sponsored by the game's developers, its publishers, its
engine vendor, or any other rights holder. It requires a legitimately
purchased copy of the game, and it contains no game code, no extracted game
assets, no game data files and no proprietary DLLs. The sole piece of
game-owned material in this repository is the README gameplay clip covered in
the previous section, which is redistributed in no release.

The mod locates the engine structures it reads by recording their addresses and
field offsets: RVAs and struct offsets in `src/Subnautica2HeadTracking/builds/`,
and UObject class, property and function names looked up by name at runtime.
Those were derived by the authors through independent analysis of a
legitimately owned copy, and they are factual measurements about where things
sit, recorded as numbers and names. No game code is stored here in any form -
no decompiled source, no disassembly, and no copied byte sequences. The
derivation scripts under `scripts/` match against prologue bytes of the game's
own functions, so those bytes are generated locally from the reader's own
installed copy by `scripts/make_signatures.py` into a gitignored file, and are
never committed.
